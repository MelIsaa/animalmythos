                            Few animals capture peopleâ€™s imagination quite like the wolf. 
                            For thousands of years, the wolf has fascinated us, 
                            frightened us, and drawn us in.

                            <p class="drop-cap">In many cultures throughout the world, foxes are constantly 
                                depicted as something akin to a trickster deity, or even 
                                familiar animals that possesses magical attributes. Much 
                                like with the Big Bad Wolf from various fairy tales, 
                                foxes are constantlly depicted as antagonistic forces 
                                who would use their intelligence to outsmart their prey, 
                                or to escape from harm.</p>
                            <p>However, there have been some myths surrounding this animal 
                                that have placed it in a more positive light. For example, 
                                in the Achomawi creation myth, the Fox is believed to 
                                have helped the Coyote create the world, and they both 
                                left before humanity arrived. The fox also acted as a 
                                messenger animal for Ninhursag in Mesopotamian mythology, 
                                and they were worshiped as sacred animals in ancient 
                                Peru by the Moche people.</p>
                            <p>The cunning nature of foxes in folklore, myth and fables 
                                has led to modern phrases such as "outfox" - which means 
                                to trick or outsmart someone.</p>

                            They use to believe that the foxes are warriors which 
                            would use it's mind to fight the victims, to the point 
                            they wouldn't make any physical damage, only mentally. 
                            Inside of the 19th century American folktales created by 
                            Joel harris, Br'er Fox is the major character, which is 
                            always acting towards the main portagonist of the 
                            stories the Br'er Rabbit.</p>

                            foxes are more malevolent in nature and a danger to 
                            humanity. In Japanese folklore, foxes are the typical

                            versions of the myth, kitsunes are violent predators 
                            that often seek to kill everything in their path. Some 
                            kitsunes are even known to drive their victims to total 
                            madness by "possession." This is a practice that is
