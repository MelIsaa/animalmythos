                <h2>Crows and Ravens</h2>
                    <p class="l drop-cap">Both crows and ravens have appeared in a number of different 
                        mythologies throughout the ages. In some cases, these 
                        black-feathered birds are considered an omen of bad 
                        tidings, but in others, they may represent a message from 
                        the Divine. Here are some fascinating crow and raven folklore to ponder.</p>
                    <ul class="did-you-know">
                        <h5>Did You Know?</h5>
                        <li>Crows sometimes appear as a method of divination and prophecy.</li>
                        <li>In some mythologies, crows are seen as a sign of bad 
                            things to come, but in others they are considered to be 
                            messengers from the gods.</li>
                        <li>Crows often appear as trickster characters in folklore and legend.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Although crows and ravens are part of the same family (Corvus), 
                        they’re not exactly the same bird. Typically, ravens are much 
                        bigger than crows, and they tend to be a bit shaggier looking. 
                        The raven actually has more in common with hawks and other 
                        predatory birds than the standard, smaller-sized crow. In 
                        addition, although both birds have an impressive repertoire 
                        of calls and noises they make, the raven’s call is usually a 
                        bit deeper and more guttural sounding than that of the crow.</p>

                                Few animals capture people’s imagination quite like the wolf. 
                                For thousands of years, the wolf has fascinated us, 
                                frightened us, and drawn us in.

                            <p>In many cultures throughout the world, foxes are constantly 
                        depicted as something akin to a trickster deity, or even 
                        familiar animals that possesses magical attributes. 
                        Foxes are constantly depicted as antagonistic forces 
                        who would use their intelligence to outsmart their prey, 
                        or to escape from harm.</p>

                    <section id="raven-crow-myth" class="col-9">
                        <p class="drop-cap">In Celtic mythology, the warrior goddess known as the 
                            Morrighan often appears in the form of a crow or raven 
                            or is seen accompanied by a group of them. Typically, 
                            these birds appear in groups of three, and they are seen 
                            as a sign that the Morrighan is watching—or possibly 
                            getting ready to pay someone a visit.</p>
                        <p>In some tales of the Welsh myth cycle, the Mabinogion, 
                            the raven is a harbinger of death. Witches and sorcerers 
                            were believed to have the ability to transform themselves 
                            into ravens and fly away, thus enabling them to evade capture.</p>
                        <p>The Native Americans often saw the raven as a trickster, 
                            much like Coyote. There are a number of tales regarding 
                            the mischief of Raven, who is sometimes seen as a symbol 
                            of transformation. In the legends of various tribes, 
                            Raven is typically associated with everything from the 
                            creation of the world to the gift of sunlight to mankind. 
                            Some tribes knew the raven as a stealer of souls.</p>
                        <p>Native-Languages.org says,</p>
                            <blockquote>"In Native American folklore, the intelligence 
                                of crows is usually portrayed as their most important 
                                feature. In some tribes, the crow is conflated with 
                                the raven, a larger cousin of the crow that shares 
                                many of the same characteristics. In other tribes, 
                                Crow and Raven are distinct mythological characters. 
                                Crows are also used as clan animals in some Native 
                                American cultures."</blockquote>
                        <p>Some of the tribes with Crow clans include the Chippewa, 
                            the Hopi, the Tlingit, and the Pueblo tribes of the 
                            American Southwest.</p>
                        <p>In the Norse pantheon, Odin is often 
                            represented by the raven—usually a pair of them. Early 
                            artwork depicts him as being accompanied by two black 
                            birds, who are described in the Eddas as Huginn and Munnin. 
                            Their names translate to “thought” and “memory,” and their 
                            job is to serve as Odin’s spies, bringing him news each 
                            night from the land of men.</p>

                    <section id="divination-superstition" class="col-9">
                        <p class="drop-cap">Crows sometimes appear as a method of divination. For the 
                            ancient Greeks, the crow was a symbol of Apollo in his 
                            role as god of prophecy. Augury—divination using birds—was 
                            popular among both the Greeks and the Romans, and augurs 
                            interpreted messages based on not only the color of a 
                            bird but the direction from which it flew. A crow flying 
                            in from the east or south was considered favorable.</p>
                        <p>In parts of the Appalachian mountains, a low-flying group 
                            of crows means that illness is coming—but if a crow flies 
                            over a house and calls three times, that means an 
                            impending death in the family. If the crows call in the 
                            morning before the other birds get a chance to sing, it’s 
                            going to rain. Despite their role as messengers of doom 
                            and gloom, it’s bad luck to kill a crow. If you accidentally 
                            do so, you’re supposed to bury it—and be sure to wear 
                            black when you do!</p>
                        <p>In some places, it's not the sighting of a crow or raven 
                            itself, but the number that you see which is important. 
                            Mike Cahill at Creepy Basement says,</p>
                        <blockquote>"Seeing just a single crow is considered an omen 
                            of bad luck. Finding two crows, however, means good luck. 
                            Three crows mean health, and four crows mean wealth. 
                            Yet spotting five crows means sickness is coming, and 
                            witnessing six crows means death is nearby."</blockquote>
                        <p>Within the Christian religion, ravens hold a special 
                            significance. While they are referred to as “unclean” 
                            within the Bible, Genesis tells us that after the flood 
                            waters receded, the raven was the first bird Noah sent 
                            out from the ark to find land. Also, in the Hebrew 
                            Talmud, ravens are credited with teaching mankind how to 
                            deal with death; when Cain slew Abel, a raven showed 
                            Adam and Eve how to bury the body, because they had 
                            never done so before.</p>
