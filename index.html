                            <h2>Theme Overview</h2>
                            <p class="l drop-cap">Since the beginning of human history, people have lived 
                                in close contact with animals—usually as <a href="#">hunters</a> and 
                                <a href="#">farmers</a>—and have developed myths and legends about them.
                                All kinds of creatures, from fierce leopards to tiny 
                                spiders, play important roles in mythology. A myth can 
                                give special meaning or extraordinary qualities to 
                                common animals such as frogs and bears. However, 
                                other creatures found in myths, such as many-headed 
                                monsters, dragons , and unicorns , never existed in the 
                                real world.</p>
                            <section id="major-myths">
                                <p class="two-col">Many myths explore relationships between humans and animals. 
                                    People may talk with animals, fight them, or even marry 
                                    them. Sometimes animals perform services for humans, 
                                    including guiding them through the underworld or helping 
                                    them complete tasks. One large group of myths involving 
                                    animals concerns transformations, or changes, between 
                                    human and animal states. Other myths focus on the close 
                                    connection between people and animals.</p>

                                Few animals capture people’s imagination quite like the wolf. 
                                For thousands of years, the wolf has fascinated us, 
                                frightened us, and drawn us in.

                            <p>Both crows and ravens have appeared in a number of different 
                    mythologies throughout the ages. In some cases, these 
                    black-feathered birds are considered an omen of bad 
                    tidings, but in others, they may represent a message from 
                    the Divine.</p>

                            <p>In many cultures throughout the world, foxes are constantly 
                        depicted as something akin to a trickster deity, or even 
                        familiar animals that possesses magical attributes. 
                        Foxes are constantly depicted as antagonistic forces 
                        who would use their intelligence to outsmart their prey, 
                        or to escape from harm.</p>

                                <p class="drop-cap">A princess kisses an enchanted frog and he 
                                    becomes a handsome prince with whom, the 
                                    fairy tale tells us, she will live “happily 
                                    ever after.” Such transformations, in which 
                                    people turn into animals or animals turn 
                                    into people, take place in myths and legends 
                                    from around the world. Transformation myths 
                                    are about crossing the boundaries that set 
                                    humans apart from the rest of the world.</p>
                                <p><a href="#">Native American</a> mythologies describe a time 
                                    in the past when the boundaries between 
                                    people and animals were less sharply drawn 
                                    and beings freely changed form. This is 
                                    known as shape shifting. Bears were 
                                    especially close to humans, and in some 
                                    <a href="#">Native American</a> stories, bears appear as 
                                    humans wearing coats made of bearskins. The 
                                    Tsimshian (pronounced CHIM-shee-an) people 
                                    of southern Alaska and the northern coast 
                                    of British Columbia tell about Asdiwal, a 
                                    young man who follows a white bear up a 
                                    mountain to the sky. He discovers that the 
                                    beast is actually a beautiful woman dressed 
                                    in a bear skin, and he marries her.</p>
                                <p><blockquote>The ancient Greeks and Romans believed that 
                                    the gods could blur the boundaries between 
                                    different classes of beings.</blockquote> Ovid's 
                                    Metamorphoses is a collection of Greek and 
                                    Roman legends about mortals whom the gods 
                                    turned into animals and plants. Both Chinese 
                                    and Slavic mythologies include tales of 
                                    people who, under some evil force, turn 
                                    into werewolves.</p>
                                <p>The Scots have stories about selkies 
                                    (pronounced SEL-keez), imaginary sea 
                                    creatures that resemble seals and take on 
                                    human form, marry men and women, and then 
                                    return to the sea. In fact, the theme of 
                                    animal wives or husbands comes up over and 
                                    over again in mythology. Native Americans 
                                    tell of girls marrying bears and men marrying 
                                    deer. Eskimo and Chinese tales mention 
                                    beautiful, seductive women who turn out to 
                                    be foxes in disguise. In one Eskimo story, 
                                    a woman enters the home of a hunter while 
                                    he is out. She cooks for him and stays for 
                                    some time, but eventually she puts on her 
                                    fox skin and disappears. The well-known 
                                    fable of Beauty and the Beast is a modern 
                                    version of the myth of the animal husband 
                                    whose beastly form cannot disguise his 
                                    noble soul.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes transformations are forced on 
                                    people by sorcerers, or magicians, or as 
                                    punishment for offending the gods. When 
                                    people voluntarily seek transformation, 
                                    however, the change can be a sign of power. 
                                    In many societies, individuals called 
                                    shamans were thought to have supernatural 
                                    abilities, including the power to communicate 
                                    with animals or to transform themselves 
                                    into animals. South American shamans were 
                                    said to be able to change themselves into 
                                    jaguars.</p>

                            <p class="drop-cap">The fact that animals play a role in the mythologies of 
                                all cultures demonstrates their universal importance to 
                                human society. Animals were and are an important source 
                                of food, labor, and even companionship to people 
                                everywhere. Domesticated animals such as one finds on a 
                                farm, in particular, were the backbone of agricultural 
                                societies, while more nomadic hunter societies relied 
                                on wild animals for food and for their skins. Although 
                                modern cultures continue to use animals for the same 
                                purposes as they did thousands of years ago, ancient 
                                cultures relied heavily on animals for survival, and 
                                lived closer to wild animals than people do today. This 
                                heavy reliance on, and physical closeness to, animals, 
                                resulted in a rich oral tradition in which animals both 
                                help and harm humans. They provide people with food, 
                                but they can also be dangerous.
                             </p>

                                Animals represent the 
                                mystery and power of the natural world, which has the 
                                ability to create and destroy. Animals may serve as 
                                stand-ins for humans or human characteristics, as in the 
                                African and Native American trickster tales or the 
                                fables of the Greek storyteller Aesop. In some legends, 
                                animals perform heroic deeds or act as mediators or 
                                go-betweens for gods and humans. They may also be the 
                                source of the wisdom and power of a shaman, a person 
                                who has contact with the spiritual realm and uses magic 
                                to heal the members of his tribe.</p>
