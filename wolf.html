                <h2>Wolf Folklore and Legend</h2>
                <p class="l drop-cap">Few animals capture people’s imagination quite like the wolf. 
                    For thousands of years, the wolf has fascinated us, 
                    frightened us, and drawn us in. Perhaps it’s because there’s 
                    a part of us that identifies with that wild, untamed spirit 
                    we see in the wolf. The wolf features prominently in myths 
                    and legends from many North American and European cultures, 
                    as well as from other places around the world. Let’s look at 
                    some of the stories still told today about the wolf.</p>

                        <p>Both crows and ravens have appeared in a number of different 
                        mythologies throughout the ages. In some cases, these 
                        black-feathered birds are considered an omen of bad 
                        tidings, but in others, they may represent a message from 
                        the Divine.</p>

                            <p class="drop-cap">In the stories of the Ulster cycle, the Celtic goddess 
                                Morrighan is sometimes shown as a wolf. The connection 
                                with the wolf, along with the cow, suggests that in some 
                                areas, she may have been linked to fertility and land. 
                                Prior to her role as a warrior goddess, she was linked 
                                to sovereignty and kingship.</p>
                            <p>In Scotland, the goddess known as Cailleach is often 
                                associated with wolf folklore. She is an old woman who 
                                brings destruction and winter with her and rules the 
                                dark half of the year. She is portrayed riding a speeding 
                                wolf, bearing a hammer or a wand made of human flesh. 
                                In addition to her role as destroyer, she is depicted 
                                as a protector of wild things, like the wolf itself, 
                                according to the Carmina Gadelica.</p>
                            <p>Dan Puplett of TreesForLife describes the status of wolves in Scotland. He says,</p>
                                <blockquote>"In Scotland, as early as the 2nd Century BC, 
                                    King Dorvadilla decreed that anyone who killed a wolf 
                                    would be rewarded with an ox, and in the 15th Century 
                                    James the First of Scotland ordered the eradication 
                                    of wolves in the kingdom. 'Last wolf' legends are 
                                    found in many parts of Scotland, although the very 
                                    last was allegedly killed in 1743, near the River 
                                    Findhorn by a stalker named MacQueen. However, the 
                                    historic accuracy of this story is dubious... Werewolf
                                    legends were particularly prevalent in parts of 
                                    Eastern Europe until very recently. The Scottish 
                                    equivalent is the legend of the Wulver on Shetland. 
                                    The Wulver was said to have the body of a man and 
                                    the head of a wolf."</blockquote>

                            <p class="drop-cap">The wolf features prominently in a number of Native 
                                American stories. There is a Lakota tale about a woman 
                                who was injured while traveling. She was found by a wolf 
                                pack that took her in and nurtured her. During her time 
                                with them, she learned the ways of the wolves, and when 
                                she returned to her tribe, she used her newfound knowledge 
                                to help her people. In particular, she knew far before 
                                anyone else when a predator or enemy was approaching.</p>
                            <p>A Cherokee tale tells the story of the dog and the wolf. 
                                Originally, Dog lived on the mountain, and Wolf lived 
                                beside the fire. When winter came, though, Dog got cold, 
                                so he came down and sent Wolf away from the fire. Wolf 
                                went to the mountains and found that he liked it there. 
                                Wolf prospered in the mountains, and formed a clan of 
                                his own, while Dog stayed by the fire with the people. 
                                Eventually, the people killed Wolf, but his brothers 
                                came down and took revenge. Ever since then, Dog has 
                                been man’s faithful companion, but the people are wise 
                                enough not to hunt Wolf anymore.</p>

                            <p class="drop-cap">For Roman Pagans, the wolf is important indeed. The 
                                founding of Rome–and thus, an entire empire–was based 
                                on the story of Romulus and Remus, orphaned twins who 
                                were raised by a she-wolf. The name of the Lupercalia 
                                festival comes from the Latin Lupus, which means wolf. 
                                Lupercalia is held every year in February and is a 
                                multi-purpose event that celebrates the fertility of 
                                not only the livestock but people as well.</p>
                            <p>In Turkey, the wolf is held in high regard, and is seen 
                                in a similar light as to the Romans; the wolf Ashina Tuwu 
                                is the mother of the first of the great Khans. Also 
                                called Asena, she rescued an injured boy, nursed him 
                                back to health, and then bore him ten half-wolf half-human 
                                children. The eldest of these, Bumin Khayan, became 
                                chieftain of the Turkic tribes. Today the wolf is still 
                                seen as a symbol of sovereignty and leadership.</p>

                            <p class="drop-cap">In Norse legend, Tyr (also Tiw) is the one-handed warrior 
                                god... and he lost his hand to the great wolf, Fenrir. 
                                When the gods decided Fenrir had been causing too much 
                                trouble, they decided to put him in shackles. However, 
                                Fenrir was so strong that there was no chain that could 
                                hold him. The dwarves created a magical ribbon–called 
                                Gleipnir–that even Fenrir couldn’t escape. Fenrir was no 
                                fool and said he'd only allow himself to be tied with 
                                Gleipnir if one of the gods was willing to stick a hand 
                                in Fenrir's mouth. Tyr offered to do it, and once his 
                                hand was in Fenrir's mouth, the other gods tied Fenrir 
                                so he couldn’t escape. Tyr's right hand got bitten off 
                                in the struggle. Tyr is known in some stories as the 
                                "Leavings of the Wolf."</p>
                            <p>The Inuit peoples of North America hold the great wolf 
                                Amarok in high regard. Amarok was a lone wolf and did 
                                not travel with a pack. He was known for preying upon 
                                hunters foolish enough to go out at night. According to 
                                legend, Amarok came to the people when the caribou 
                                became so plentiful that the herd began to weaken and 
                                fall sick. Amarok came to prey upon the frail and ill 
                                caribou, thus allowing the herd to become healthy once 
                                more, so that man could hunt.</p>

                            <p class="drop-cap">In North America, wolves today have gotten a pretty bad rap. 
                                Over the past few centuries, Americans of European 
                                descent have systematically destroyed many of the wolf 
                                packs that existed and thrived in the United States.
